                            Chapter 1019: "Heliceratops"
                            With Sasaki's forces now defected, Franky is able to take on the Tobiroppo one-on-one. The
                            two of them fight ferociously, with Sasaki showing the ability to make his triceratops frill
                            spin rapidly and become a weapon as well as lift himself up into the air. Sasaki unleashes a
                            powerful finishing blow against the General Franky and greatly damages it, but Franky
                            manages to eject from it in time. He then unleashes a "Radical Beam" which strikes Sasaki in
                            the stomach and brings him down.
