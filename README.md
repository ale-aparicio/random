# Straw Facts 
**Straw Facts** is a community-based website for all One Piece enthusiasts looking to share their thoughts and theories with others.

The inspiration for the website came from the countless theories roaming around the internet in different forums and websites, so the idea is to have a place where fans and speculators can create, find, and share their theories with everyone and have one place to find everything rather than having the information spread across different platforms.
